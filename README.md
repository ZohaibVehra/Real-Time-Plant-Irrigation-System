# Real-Time-Plant-Irrigation-System
IoT project revolving around a moisture reader and a valve for real time interactive plant irrigation. Created with an ESP32 board using a websocket connection all done in Arduino IDE

Components Used:

NodeMCU ESP32 board
Walfront soil moisture sensor v1.2
DIGITEN DC 12V 1/4" Inlet Feed Water Solenoid Valve
FQP30N06L N-CH Mosfet
A 100KOhm Resistor and a 100Ohm Resistor
Note that the load resistor in the schematic represents our Valve. (An actual 1k resistor there would reduce the curret to 12mA when our valve requires 400mA)
